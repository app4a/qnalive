# Authentication Flow for Questions

## Overview
The "Allow Anonymous Questions" setting controls whether participants need to be signed in to ask questions at an event.

## Setting Behavior

### Allow Anonymous Questions = ON (Default)
- âœ… Anyone can submit questions without signing in
- âœ… Participants can optionally provide their name (or remain "Anonymous")
- âœ… Signed-in users automatically use their account name

### Allow Anonymous Questions = OFF
- ðŸ”’ Only signed-in users can submit questions
- ðŸ”’ Non-authenticated users see a "Sign In" button instead of the question form
- âœ… Questions automatically use the signed-in user's name from their account

## Implementation Details

### API Validation (`/api/events/[eventId]/questions`)
```typescript
if (settings.allowAnonymous === false && !session?.user?.id) {
  return 401 error: 'You must be signed in to ask questions at this event.'
}
```

### UI Behavior (`/e/[code]/page.tsx`)

**When allowAnonymous = false AND user not signed in:**
```tsx
<div className="text-center py-8">
  <p>You must be signed in to ask questions at this event.</p>
  <Button asChild>
    <a href="/auth/signin">Sign In to Ask Questions</a>
  </Button>
</div>
```

**When allowAnonymous = true OR user is signed in:**
- Shows question submission form
- For authenticated users: Name field is hidden, uses account name
- For anonymous users: Shows optional "Your Name" field

## Default Settings

New events are created with:
```json
{
  "allowAnonymous": true,
  "moderationEnabled": false,
  "showResultsImmediately": true,
  "allowParticipantPolls": false
}
```

## Use Cases
