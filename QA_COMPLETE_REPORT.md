### Concurrency Test Scenarios

#### CONC-QU-001: Question Upvoting - Race Conditions
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Setup:** 10 participants, 1 existing question

**Test Steps:**
1. All 10 users click upvote on the SAME question at the SAME TIME
2. Monitor upvotesCount in real-time
3. Query database: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM QuestionUpvote WHERE questionId = ?`
4. Verify final count on all screens

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úì Database shows exactly 10 upvote records
- ‚úì Question.upvotesCount = 10
- ‚úì All screens show count = 10
- ‚úì All 10 users see their upvote highlighted

#### CONC-PV-001: Poll Voting - Race Conditions
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Setup:** 20 participants, 1 active poll with 3 options

**Test Steps:**
1. All 20 users vote at the SAME TIME (within 2 seconds)
2. Monitor Socket.io poll:voted events
3. Query database vote counts per option
4. Verify all screens show correct counts

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úì Database: Option A = 10 votes, B = 7, C = 3
- ‚úì All screens show correct distribution
- ‚úì No duplicate votes from same user
- ‚úì Total poll votes = 20

### Data Integrity Verification Queries

```sql
-- 1. Verify question upvote counts match actual upvotes
SELECT q.id, q."upvotesCount", COUNT(qu.id) as actual_count
FROM "Question" q
LEFT JOIN "QuestionUpvote" qu ON q.id = qu."questionId"
GROUP BY q.id
HAVING q."upvotesCount" != COUNT(qu.id);
-- Expected: 0 rows

-- 2. Verify poll vote counts
SELECT po.id, po."votesCount", COUNT(pv.id) as actual_votes
FROM "PollOption" po
LEFT JOIN "PollVote" pv ON po.id = pv."optionId"
GROUP BY po.id
HAVING po."votesCount" != COUNT(pv.id);
-- Expected: 0 rows

-- 3. Check for duplicate question upvotes
SELECT "questionId", "userId", COUNT(*)
FROM "QuestionUpvote"
WHERE "userId" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY "questionId", "userId"
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
-- Expected: 0 rows

-- 4. Check for duplicate poll votes
SELECT "pollId", "userId", COUNT(*)
FROM "PollVote"
WHERE "userId" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY "pollId", "userId"
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
-- Expected: 0 rows
```

## üêõ BUGS FOUND & FIXED

### ‚úÖ CRITICAL BUGS (ALL FIXED)

#### BUG-001: Poll Voting - Missing Database Unique Constraints
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** ‚úì FIXED  
**Location:** `prisma/schema.prisma`

**Problem:**
The `PollVote` model lacked unique constraints to prevent duplicate votes. Users could potentially vote multiple times on the same poll.

**Fix Applied:**
```prisma
model PollVote {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  pollId      String
  optionId    String
  userId      String?
  sessionId   String?  @db.VarChar(255)
  
  poll        Poll     @relation(fields: [pollId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  option      PollOption @relation(fields: [optionId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  user        User?    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  
  @@unique([pollId, userId])      // ‚úÖ Added
  @@unique([pollId, sessionId])   // ‚úÖ Added
  @@index([pollId])
  @@index([optionId])
}
```

**Impact:** Prevented users from voting multiple times ‚úÖ

---

#### BUG-002: Poll Voting - No Transaction Wrapper (API Route)
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** ‚úì FIXED  
**Location:** `/app/api/events/[eventId]/polls/[id]/vote/route.ts` (POST)

**Problem:**
Vote creation and count increment were separate operations:
```typescript
// Before: Two separate operations - not atomic
await prisma.pollVote.create({ ... })        // Step 1
await prisma.pollOption.update({ ... })      // Step 2
// If Step 2 fails, data is inconsistent!
```

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// After: Wrapped in transaction - atomic
await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  await tx.pollVote.create({ ... })
  await tx.pollOption.update({ ... })
  // Both succeed or both fail - data always consistent ‚úÖ
})
```

**Impact:** Prevents data inconsistency if operation fails mid-process ‚úÖ

---

#### BUG-003: Poll Unvoting - No Transaction Wrapper (API Route)
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** ‚úì FIXED  
**Location:** `/app/api/events/[eventId]/polls/[id]/vote/route.ts` (DELETE)

**Problem:**
Vote deletion and count decrement were separate operations, leading to same issue as BUG-002.

**Fix Applied:**
Wrapped both `PollVote.deleteMany` and `PollOption.update` in `prisma.$transaction()`.

**Impact:** Prevents data inconsistency during unvoting ‚úÖ

---

### üü£ DEAD CODE (NOT AFFECTING PRODUCTION)

#### BUG-004: Socket.io Question Upvote Handler
**Severity:** ~~HIGH~~ ‚Üí **DEAD CODE**  
**Status:** ‚úÖ REMOVED  
**Location:** `/lib/socket.ts` lines 117-150

**Discovery:** Client code does NOT use this handler! All upvoting goes through API routes.

**Verification:**
```bash
# No client-side socket.emit calls found
$ grep -r "socket.emit" app/ components/
# Result: NO MATCHES ‚úì

# All upvoting uses API routes:
‚úì POST /api/events/.../upvote (uses transaction)
‚úì DELETE /api/events/.../upvote (uses transaction)
```

**Action Taken:** Removed dead code (see Enhancement #1)

---

#### BUG-005: Socket.io Poll Vote Handler
**Severity:** ~~HIGH~~ ‚Üí **DEAD CODE**  
**Status:** ‚úÖ REMOVED  
**Location:** `/lib/socket.ts` lines 229-268

**Discovery:** Client code does NOT use this handler! All voting goes through API routes.

**Action Taken:** Removed dead code (see Enhancement #1)

---

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY (FIXED)

#### BUG-006: Participant Count - Race Condition
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Location:** `/lib/socket.ts` lines 71-75

**Problem:**
When multiple users joined simultaneously, the participant count query might be stale:
```typescript
// Before: Immediate count query
await prisma.eventParticipant.upsert({ ... })
const count = await prisma.eventParticipant.count({ ... })
io?.to(eventId).emit('event:participants', { count })
// With 10 rapid joins, this runs 10 times with potentially stale data
```

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// After: Debounced count query
await prisma.eventParticipant.upsert({ ... })
// Schedule count after 500ms (debounced)
setTimeout(async () => {
  const count = await prisma.eventParticipant.count({ ... })
  io?.to(eventId).emit('event:participants', { count })
}, 500)
// With 10 rapid joins, this runs ONCE with accurate data ‚úÖ
```

**Impact:** Fixed cosmetic race condition, improved performance ‚úÖ

---

### üîµ LOW PRIORITY (BY DESIGN)

#### BUG-007: Socket.io Event Emission Outside Transaction
**Severity:** LOW  
**Status:** ACCEPTED (By Design)  
**Location:** Multiple files

**Issue:** If socket emit fails, database is updated but clients not notified.

**Decision:** **Accept as-is** - This is correct design pattern.
- Database consistency > real-time notifications
- Temporary stale UI until refresh is acceptable
- Error is logged for monitoring

## üöÄ ENHANCEMENTS APPLIED

### Enhancement #1: Remove Dead Socket.io Code ‚úÖ

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED on 2025-10-26

**What Was Done:**
Removed 7 unused Socket.io event handlers from `/lib/socket.ts` that were never called by client code.

**Removed Handlers:**
1. ‚ùå `question:submit` (Lines 89-114)
2. ‚ùå `question:upvote` (Lines 117-150)
3. ‚ùå `question:update` (Lines 152-177)
4. ‚ùå `question:delete` (Lines 179-191)
5. ‚ùå `poll:create` (Lines 193-226)
6. ‚ùå `poll:vote` (Lines 229-268)
7. ‚ùå `poll:status` (Lines 271-287)

**Why Removed:**
- Not called by any client code (verified via grep)
- All operations use API routes instead
- Created confusion about code paths
- Contained logic without transactions (would be bugs if used)

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Removed ~200 lines of unused code
- ‚úÖ File size: 312 lines ‚Üí 163 lines (47.8% reduction)
- ‚úÖ Clearer architecture (API for mutations, Socket.io for broadcasts)
- ‚úÖ Better maintainability
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive documentation

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// ============================================================
// REMOVED DEAD CODE: The following Socket.io event handlers
// were not used by any client code (all operations go through
// API routes instead). Removed for code clarity and to prevent
// confusion about which code path is actually used.
//
// Removed handlers:
// - question:submit, question:upvote, question:update, question:delete
// - poll:create, poll:vote, poll:status
//
// All these operations are handled by API routes:
// - POST /api/events/[eventId]/questions
// - POST /api/events/[eventId]/questions/[id]/upvote
// - PUT /api/events/[eventId]/questions/[id]
// - DELETE /api/events/[eventId]/questions/[id]
// - POST /api/events/[eventId]/polls
// - POST /api/events/[eventId]/polls/[id]/vote
// - PUT /api/events/[eventId]/polls/[id]
//
// Socket.io is used ONLY for broadcasting events after
// successful API operations, not for initiating them.
// ============================================================
```

### Enhancement #2: Fix Participant Count Race Condition ‚úÖ

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED on 2025-10-26

**What Was Done:**
Implemented debouncing for participant count broadcasts to prevent race condition when multiple users join simultaneously.

**The Problem:**
```
Multiple users joining simultaneously ‚Üí Multiple count queries

User A joins ‚Üí Count query (result: 1)
User B joins ‚Üí Count query (result: 1, should be 2)
User C joins ‚Üí Count query (result: 2, should be 3)

Result: Clients see: 1, 1, 2 instead of 1, 2, 3
```

**The Solution:**
```
Multiple users join ‚Üí Single count query after 500ms

User A joins ‚îÄ‚îê
User B joins  ‚îú‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Wait 500ms ‚Üí Count query (result: 3)
User C joins ‚îÄ‚îò

Result: Clients see: 3 (accurate, efficient)
```

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Added global state for debouncing
const participantCountTimeouts: Map<string, NodeJS.Timeout> = 
  globalForSocket.participantCountTimeouts || new Map()

// In event:join handler
const existingTimeout = participantCountTimeouts.get(eventId)
if (existingTimeout) {
  clearTimeout(existingTimeout)
}

const timeout = setTimeout(async () => {
  try {
    const count = await prisma.eventParticipant.count({
      where: { eventId },
    })
    io?.to(eventId).emit('event:participants', { count })
    participantCountTimeouts.delete(eventId)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error broadcasting participant count:', error)
  }
}, 500)

participantCountTimeouts.set(eventId, timeout)
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Eliminated race condition
- ‚úÖ Reduced database queries (10 joins = 1 query instead of 10)
- ‚úÖ More accurate participant counts
- ‚úÖ Better performance under load
- ‚úÖ Error handling prevents crashes

- [x] Code quality improved
- [x] Performance optimized
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Database migration ready
- [x] No linting errors
- [x] Optional enhancements applied

### Database Migration

**IMPORTANT:** Run this before deploying:

```bash
# Apply database migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Verify migration status
npx prisma migrate status

# Expected output: "Database schema is up to date!"
```

**Migrations Applied:**
1. `20251027071411_qatest_feedback` - Added unique constraints for poll votes

### Deployment Steps

```bash
# 1. Ensure database is migrated
npx prisma migrate deploy

# 2. Build for production
npm run build

# 3. Start production server
npm run start

# OR if using Docker/Vercel/other platform:
# Follow their specific deployment guide
```

### Post-Deployment Verification

#### Step 1: Run Data Integrity Checks

```sql
-- 1. Verify question upvote counts
SELECT q.id, q."upvotesCount", COUNT(qu.id) as actual
FROM "Question" q
LEFT JOIN "QuestionUpvote" qu ON q.id = qu."questionId"
GROUP BY q.id
HAVING q."upvotesCount" != COUNT(qu.id);
-- Expected: 0 rows ‚úì

-- 2. Verify poll vote counts
SELECT po.id, po."votesCount", COUNT(pv.id) as actual
FROM "PollOption" po
LEFT JOIN "PollVote" pv ON po.id = pv."optionId"
GROUP BY po.id
HAVING po."votesCount" != COUNT(pv.id);
-- Expected: 0 rows ‚úì

-- 3. Check for duplicate question upvotes
SELECT "questionId", "userId", COUNT(*)
FROM "QuestionUpvote"
WHERE "userId" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY "questionId", "userId"
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
-- Expected: 0 rows ‚úì

-- 4. Check for duplicate poll votes
SELECT "pollId", "userId", COUNT(*)
FROM "PollVote"
WHERE "userId" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY "pollId", "userId"
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
-- Expected: 0 rows ‚úì
```

#### Step 2: Smoke Test

1. **Create a test event**
   - ‚úì Event created with unique code
   - ‚úì Can access via `/e/{code}`

2. **Submit test questions**
   - ‚úì Question appears immediately
   - ‚úì Real-time updates work
   - ‚úì Moderation works (if enabled)

3. **Vote on test polls**
   - ‚úì Vote recorded correctly
   - ‚úì Cannot vote twice
   - ‚úì Can unvote
   - ‚úì Real-time updates work

4. **Test with multiple users**
   - ‚úì Open 2-3 browser tabs
   - ‚úì Actions in one tab reflect in others
   - ‚úì No duplicate notifications

#### Step 3: Monitor

**First 24 Hours:**
- Monitor error logs for unexpected issues
- Watch participant counts during events
- Verify no duplicate vote issues
- Check database integrity queries

### Rollback Plan (If Needed)

**Note:** Rollback is extremely low risk because:
- Removed code was never used
- Debouncing only delays broadcasts by 500ms
- API routes remain unchanged
- No breaking changes to client code

**If issues arise:**
```bash
# Rollback code changes
git checkout lib/socket.ts

# Rollback database (only if necessary)
npx prisma migrate down --name add-poll-vote-unique-constraints
```

## üìö APPENDIX: REFERENCE MATERIALS

### Architectural Decisions

#### Socket.io Usage Pattern (Established)

**Decision:** Socket.io is used ONLY for broadcasting events after successful API operations, never for initiating operations.

**Rationale:**
1. **Single Source of Truth:** API routes handle all business logic
2. **Better Testing:** API routes easier to test than Socket handlers
3. **Consistency:** All operations use same code path (transactions, validation, auth)
4. **Simpler Debugging:** Easier to trace through API routes than Socket handlers

**Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ All mutations: API routes
- ‚úÖ All broadcasts: Socket.io
- ‚úÖ Pattern documented in code comments

### Lessons Learned

#### Architectural Insights
1. **API-First Design Works** - Using API routes for all mutations and Socket.io only for broadcasts creates a cleaner, more testable architecture
2. **Dead Code Happens** - Socket.io handlers were implemented but never used; regular code reviews help identify this
3. **Transactions Are Critical** - Wrapping related operations in transactions prevents data inconsistency

#### Testing Insights
1. **Test The Actual Code Path** - We discovered Socket.io handlers weren't used by actually checking client code
2. **Race Conditions Are Real** - Concurrent operations need careful handling with transactions and constraints
3. **Comprehensive Testing Pays Off** - The full QA review uncovered issues that unit tests might miss

#### Performance Insights
1. **Debouncing Helps** - For high-frequency operations like participant counts, debouncing reduces load
2. **Less Code Is Better** - Removing 200 lines improved clarity and reduced maintenance burden
3. **Database Constraints > Application Logic** - Let the database enforce uniqueness rather than application code

### Recommendations for Future

#### Immediate (Post-Launch)
1. ‚úÖ **Deploy to production** - Everything is ready!
2. Monitor error logs for first 24 hours
3. Watch participant counts during high-traffic events
4. Verify no duplicate vote issues

#### Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Performance testing with 100+ concurrent users
2. Network interruption recovery testing
3. Consider adding load balancer if traffic is high

#### Long-Term (Next Month+)
1. Analytics dashboard (question/poll engagement metrics)
2. Export features (questions/polls to CSV)
3. Advanced moderation tools
4. Question categories/tags

### Support Resources
